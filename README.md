A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board. 

This program requires a start and end position and returns the shortest path taken by the knight to get there. This is done using a breadth first search. 

The project was quite challenging to me, so I did get some help from John Quarles' very useful [blog post](http://qdevdive.blogspot.com/2015/01/knights-travails-moving-chess-knight.html) to get started. Once I had an idea of the general principles, I wrote my own implementation.
